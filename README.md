# ahk-capslock-remap

This is an [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) script that remaps the CapsLock key for various functions to ease using keyboard only without a mouse.

The main branch is the modified old AHK v1 script that I found online - see the links in script file. Not everything from v1 is ported (and thus commented out).

The v1 branch contains the original script (mostly unmodified from the version I originally found).

# Usage

## Movement
Mostly mimics the vim hjkl movement when holding down the CapsLock.
